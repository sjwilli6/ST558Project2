Stephen Macropoulos BlogPost Project 2

What would you do differently?

For future projects I think it would be beneficial to set up live meetings with my partner(s) as opposed to only using email to communicate. 

What was the most difficult part for you?

The most difficult part of this project for me was deciding on which linear regression models to use.

What are your big take-aways from this project?

I think this project was helpful in showing me that ensemble tree methods can be very powerful in prediction compared to linear methods!
